# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

---

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev        # Start dev server (Next.js 15 + Turbopack) at http://localhost:3000
npm run build      # Production build (runs tsc + next build)
npm run lint       # ESLint via next lint
npm run start      # Start production server (after build)
```

No test suite is configured. TypeScript strict mode is **not** enabled — type errors may be silent at runtime.

## Architecture

### Stack
- **Next.js 15 App Router** — all pages under `src/app/`, API routes under `src/app/api/`
- **TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + lucide-react + sonner** (toasts)
- **Supabase** for persistence (factory DB + one per deployed site); falls back to in-memory store (`globalThis.__recipe_factory_store__`) when env vars are absent
- **OpenAI GPT-4o-mini** for recipe generation, **Pexels** for images, **Google Sheets API** for keyword input

### Data Flow
```
Google Sheet keywords
  → src/lib/generator.ts       (orchestrates a generation run)
  → src/lib/openai.ts          (recipe JSON via GPT-4o-mini)
  → src/lib/images.ts          (Pexels image fetch)
  → src/lib/store.ts           (write recipe as "draft" to factory DB)
  → [manual] bulk-publish      (src/lib/site-publisher.ts → site Supabase)
  → [manual] deploy            (src/lib/deployer.ts → Vercel API → /template site)
```

### Key Patterns
- **Server Components by default** — pages call store functions directly (no HTTP). Client interactivity lives in `*Client.tsx` siblings passed data as props.
- **`await params`** — Next.js 15 route params are `Promise<{id}>` and must be awaited in every route handler and page.
- **In-memory fallback** — `src/lib/store.ts` uses `globalThis.__recipe_factory_store__` when Supabase env vars are absent. Data resets on process restart.
- **Structured logger** — always use `createLogger("Context")` from `src/lib/logger.ts`; never `console.log/error`.
- **Retry utility** — `withRetry()` in `src/lib/utils.ts` wraps all external API calls (OpenAI, Pexels, Sheets, Vercel).
- **Scheduler** — `node-cron` via `src/instrumentation.ts` works locally; on Vercel use `vercel.json` crons hitting `/api/cron/run-schedules`.
- **Auth** — `FACTORY_PASSWORD` hashed with SHA-256 (no salt); middleware re-derives hash on every request to validate cookie.

### Two Keyword Sources (mutually exclusive per project)
| Source | When active | Files |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| Google Sheet | `project.sheet_url` is set | `src/lib/sheets.ts` |
| Built-in queue | `project.sheet_url` is empty | `builtin_keywords` table, `src/app/projects/[id]/queue/` |

### Template Site (`/template/`)
A standalone Next.js app deployed to Vercel per project. It reads recipes from the **site's own Supabase** instance (not the factory DB). Env vars are injected by `deployer.ts` at deploy time. Do not import factory code into `/template/`.

## What This App Does (Quick Summary)

A multi-tenant SaaS that auto-generates recipe websites:
1. User creates a **Project** (niche, branding, SEO, monetization)
2. Links a **Google Sheet** containing keywords (one per row, with status column)
3. Scheduler (or manual trigger) runs generation: fetches pending keywords → calls OpenAI → fetches image → stores recipe as `draft`
4. User manually bulk-publishes drafts → syncs to the site's own Supabase instance
5. User deploys the `/template` site to Vercel → live recipe site reads from site's Supabase

---

## Confirmed Bugs — Ordered by Severity

---

### BUG 1 — CRITICAL: Session Cookie Not Validated (Auth Bypass)
**Files:** `src/middleware.ts`, `src/app/api/auth/login/route.ts`

**What happens:**
- Login creates token: `hashToken(factoryPassword + Date.now().toString())` — a random SHA256 every login
- Middleware only checks: `if (!session?.value)` — any truthy cookie value bypasses auth
- **An attacker can set `factory_session=anystring` in their browser and gain full access**

**Root cause:** The token is non-deterministic (includes `Date.now()`), so the middleware cannot re-verify it. No server-side session store exists.

**Fix:** Make the token deterministic — derive it from the password only:
```typescript
// login/route.ts — change line 30:
// BEFORE:
const token = hashToken(factoryPassword + Date.now().toString());
// AFTER:
const token = hashToken(factoryPassword);
```
```typescript
// middleware.ts — add validation after line 24:
// BEFORE:
const session = request.cookies.get(SESSION_COOKIE);
if (!session?.value) { ... }
// AFTER:
const session = request.cookies.get(SESSION_COOKIE);
if (!session?.value) { ... }
const expectedToken = crypto.createHash("sha256")
  .update(factoryPassword)
  .digest("hex");
if (session.value !== expectedToken) {
  const loginUrl = new URL("/login", request.url);
  return NextResponse.redirect(loginUrl);
}
```
**Note:** Add `import * as crypto from "crypto"` to middleware.ts.

---

### BUG 2 — CRITICAL: Scheduler Dies on Every Request (Vercel Serverless)
**File:** `src/instrumentation.ts`

**What happens:**
- `node-cron` is initialized via Next.js instrumentation
- On Vercel (serverless), each API route invocation spins up a fresh Node.js process
- The cron jobs start but the process exits after the response is sent
- **Cron jobs never actually fire in a serverless environment**

**Root cause:** `node-cron` requires a persistent long-running process. Vercel serverless functions are ephemeral.

**Fix Options (pick one):**
- **Option A (Recommended for Vercel):** Replace node-cron with [Vercel Cron Jobs](https://vercel.com/docs/cron-jobs). Add a `vercel.json`:
  ```json
  {
    "crons": [
      {
        "path": "/api/cron/run-schedules",
        "schedule": "*/5 * * * *"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```
  Then create `/api/cron/run-schedules/route.ts` that calls `syncProjectSchedules()` and triggers generation for any projects whose `generation_time` has passed.
- **Option B (Self-hosted/VPS):** Keep node-cron but document that deployment must be a persistent Node.js server (e.g., Docker, Railway, Fly.io), NOT serverless Vercel.
- **Option C (Quick fix):** Add a `DEPLOYMENT_MODE=serverless|server` env var and document the limitation clearly.

---

### BUG 3 — CRITICAL: `publishRecipeToSite` Imported But Never Called in Generator
**File:** `src/lib/generator.ts` (line 11 vs. never used)

**What happens:**
- `publishRecipeToSite` is imported at line 11 of `generator.ts`
- The generator creates recipes as `status: "draft"` (line 136)
- It never calls `publishRecipeToSite()` — the import is dead code
- **Recipes are NEVER auto-published to the live site during generation**
- Users must manually click "Bulk Publish" for recipes to appear on the live site

**Root cause:** The publish step was removed from the generator loop but the import was left dangling.

**Fix:** Either:
- **Option A (Auto-publish):** After `await createRecipe(recipe)` (line 141), add:
  ```typescript
  // Publish to site Supabase if configured
  try {
    await publishRecipeToSite(projectId, { ...recipe, status: "published", published_at: new Date().toISOString() });
  } catch (pubErr) {
    log.warn("Failed to auto-publish to site (recipe saved as draft)", { title: recipe.title }, pubErr);
  }
  ```
  And change recipe status from `"draft"` to `"published"` on success.
- **Option B (Keep manual, remove dead import):** Remove line 11 import if manual-only publish is intentional. Document this clearly in the UI.

---

### BUG 4 — HIGH: `keywords_remaining` Calculation is Wrong
**File:** `src/lib/generator.ts` (line 207)

**What happens:**
- Current: `Math.max(0, totalPending - succeeded)`
- If you attempt 10 keywords and 3 fail: result = `totalPending - 7` (wrong — 3 failed keywords are also removed from pending in the sheet, marked as "failed")
- **The displayed "keywords remaining" count is inflated for every failed keyword**

**Root cause:** Both succeeded AND failed keywords are removed from the "pending" pool (they're marked as `done` or `failed` in the sheet). The subtraction should use total keywords attempted.

**Fix:**
```typescript
// generator.ts line 207 — BEFORE:
const remainingInSheet = Math.max(0, totalPending - succeeded);
// AFTER:
const remainingInSheet = Math.max(0, totalPending - keywords.length);
```

---

### BUG 5 — HIGH: Vercel Env Vars Fail on Redeploy (409 Conflict)
**File:** `src/lib/deployer.ts` (lines 96–107, `setVercelEnvVars`)

**What happens:**
- `setVercelEnvVars` calls `POST /v10/projects/{id}/env` with an array of env vars
- If the project already has these env vars (redeployment), the Vercel API returns **409 Conflict**
- The deployment fails with a cryptic error on every redeploy

**Root cause:** No upsert/update logic — always POSTs, never checks for existing vars.

**Fix:** Before posting, fetch existing env vars and delete the ones that will be updated:
```typescript
// In deployer.ts setVercelEnvVars, before the POST:
// 1. GET existing env vars
const existing = await vercelApi(`/v10/projects/${project.vercel_project_id}/env`) as { envs: Array<{ id: string; key: string }> };
// 2. Delete ones that overlap with what we're setting
const keysToSet = new Set(Object.keys(envVars));
for (const env of existing.envs ?? []) {
  if (keysToSet.has(env.key)) {
    await vercelApi(`/v10/projects/${project.vercel_project_id}/env/${env.id}`, "DELETE");
  }
}
// 3. Then POST the new values (existing POST code)
```

---

### BUG 6 — HIGH: Deployment Status Never Synced from Vercel
**File:** `src/app/api/projects/[id]/deployments/route.ts`

**What happens:**
- The `/deployments` endpoint returns whatever is in the local database
- If a deployment is `"building"`, it will show `"building"` forever unless something updates it
- `getDeploymentStatus()` exists in `deployer.ts` but is never called from the deployments route

**Fix:** In `deployments/route.ts`, after fetching from store, refresh any `"building"` deployments:
```typescript
// After: const deployments = await getDeployments(id);
// Add:
for (const dep of deployments) {
  if (dep.vercel_deployment_id && dep.status === "building") {
    try {
      const { getDeploymentStatus, updateDeploymentRecord } = await import("@/lib/deployer");
      const { state, url } = await getDeploymentStatus(dep.vercel_deployment_id);
      if (state === "READY" || state === "ERROR" || state === "CANCELED") {
        await updateDeployment(dep.id, {
          status: state === "READY" ? "ready" : "error",
          completed_at: new Date().toISOString(),
        });
        dep.status = state === "READY" ? "ready" : "error";
      }
    } catch { /* non-critical, return stale status */ }
  }
}
```

---

### BUG 7 — MEDIUM: No Retry Logic for External APIs
**Files:** `src/lib/openai.ts`, `src/lib/images.ts`, `src/lib/sheets.ts`, `src/lib/deployer.ts`

**What happens:**
- Any transient network error, rate limit (OpenAI 429), or API blip fails the entire generation run for that keyword
- No exponential backoff, no retries

**Fix:** Add a shared retry utility in `src/lib/utils.ts`:
```typescript
export async function withRetry<T>(
  fn: () => Promise<T>,
  maxAttempts = 3,
  baseDelayMs = 1000
): Promise<T> {
  for (let attempt = 1; attempt <= maxAttempts; attempt++) {
    try {
      return await fn();
    } catch (err) {
      if (attempt === maxAttempts) throw err;
      await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, baseDelayMs * Math.pow(2, attempt - 1)));
    }
  }
  throw new Error("unreachable");
}
```
Wrap OpenAI call: `await withRetry(() => getClient().chat.completions.create(...))` etc.

---

### BUG 8 — MEDIUM: `console.error` Used Instead of Logger
**File:** `src/app/api/projects/[id]/deployments/route.ts` (line 13)

**What happens:**
- `console.error("Failed to fetch deployments:", error)` bypasses the structured logger
- Inconsistent with every other API route that uses `createLogger`

**Fix:**
```typescript
// deployments/route.ts
import { createLogger } from "@/lib/logger";
const log = createLogger("API:Deployments");
// Then replace console.error:
log.error("Failed to fetch deployments", { projectId: id }, error);
```

---

### BUG 9 — MEDIUM: `last_generation_at` Field Missing from Project Type
**File:** `src/lib/types.ts` vs `src/lib/generator.ts` (line 212)

**What happens:**
- `generator.ts` line 212 calls `updateProject(projectId, { last_generation_at: ... })`
- `last_generation_at` does not exist in the `Project` interface in `types.ts`
- TypeScript may catch this (strict mode), or silently ignore it at runtime

**Fix:** Add to `src/lib/types.ts` Project interface:
```typescript
last_generation_at?: string | null;
next_scheduled_at?: string | null;
```
(Also used in `scheduler.ts` line 72 and 90.)

---

### BUG 10 — LOW: Word Count Calculation Incomplete
**File:** `src/lib/generator.ts` (lines 101–106)

**What happens:**
- Word count is computed from: `intro_content + description + instructions + tips + faq answers`
- **Missing:** `variations` array words

**Fix:**
```typescript
// After faq line, add:
+ generated.variations.join(" ").split(/\s+/).length
```

---

### BUG 11 — LOW: `site_supabase_service_key` Missing from `RECIPES_TABLE_SQL` Policy
**File:** `src/lib/site-publisher.ts` (line 195+)

**What happens:**
- The RLS policy only allows `SELECT WHERE status = 'published'`
- But there is no INSERT/UPDATE policy
- `publishRecipeToSite` uses the service key, which bypasses RLS — this is correct
- **However**, `setupSiteSchema` creates the table but doesn't add a service-role INSERT policy, relying on the service key bypassing RLS. If RLS is in force with no write policy, anon key writes would silently fail. This is fine as designed (service key only writes), but should be explicitly documented.

---

## Architecture Warnings (Not Bugs, But Important)

### WARNING 1: Vercel Serverless vs. Persistent Scheduler
`node-cron` **requires a persistent process**. If the app is deployed to Vercel Functions (default), the scheduler WILL NOT WORK. Must either:
- Use Vercel Cron Jobs (HTTP-based, free on Pro/Team plans)
- Deploy to Railway, Fly.io, Render, or a VPS with a persistent Node.js process

### WARNING 2: Manual Publish Step is Invisible to Users
The workflow has a hidden manual step: after generation, recipes sit as `draft` in the factory DB. They only appear on the live site after "Bulk Publish". This is not obvious in the UI. Add a banner/alert on the recipes page saying: _"X draft recipes are ready to publish to your live site."_

### WARNING 3: Site Schema Setup Must Happen Before First Publish
If a user deploys to Vercel but hasn't clicked "Setup Database" in the project settings, the live site will 404 on all recipe pages. This step should be automated or prominently required before deployment.

### WARNING 4: Google Private Key Format
`GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY` must be stored with literal `\n` escape sequences (not real newlines). If the key has real newlines (e.g., from copy-paste in some shells), `key.replace(/\\n/g, "\n")` will silently produce an invalid key and all Sheets calls will fail with a cryptic auth error. Document this clearly in `.env.example`.

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Always validate session tokens, not just their existence
A cookie check of `if (!session?.value)` is NOT authentication — it's just a presence check. Always re-derive or look up the expected token value server-side.

### 2. Dead imports signal incomplete features
A function imported but never called (like `publishRecipeToSite` in `generator.ts`) is a red flag that a workflow step was planned but not wired up. Review every import.

### 3. node-cron requires a persistent process — document deployment requirements upfront
Never ship scheduler logic without a prominent note about runtime requirements. Serverless ≠ long-running.

### 4. Both success and failure paths consume keywords from the pending pool
When calculating "remaining", subtract ALL attempted keywords (the batch size), not just the successful ones. Failed keywords are also removed from the "pending" state in the sheet.

### 5. Vercel API env vars need upsert, not insert
Always handle 409 Conflict on resource creation APIs. Redeploys are a normal use case.

### 6. Verify the full end-to-end path before shipping any automation
The generator created recipes that would never appear on the live site without a separate manual step — a complete break in the automated flow. Trace every data-flow arrow to its destination before considering a feature complete.

### 7. Structured logging everywhere — no console.log/error escapes
One `console.error` in `deployments/route.ts` breaks the searchable, structured log pattern of the entire codebase. Enforce the logger utility from day one.

### 8. Type system gaps hide runtime bugs
`last_generation_at` and `next_scheduled_at` fields used throughout the app were missing from the `Project` TypeScript interface. TypeScript strict mode would catch this — enable it and fix the errors.
